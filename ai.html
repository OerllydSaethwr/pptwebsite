    <p>Yiming's project is mainly based on AI and deep learning, here is some background knowledge of AI to help understanding how the moblie face tracking dataset "Mobiface" works under the work of Yiming and his team. </p>
    <p>The term Artificial Intelligence was coined by John McCarthy for the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence in 1956. However, for centuries before there been contributions from the likes of Alan Turing.</p>  
    <p>Artificial Intelligence is the theory and development of systems that perform tasks that would normally be associated with human qualities. This includes visual perception, language translation, decision making and natural language processing. In Computer Science Artificial intelligence is often defined as the study of “intelligent agents”: any device that using its perception of the environment and takes actions to maximize the probability of successfully achieving certain ambitions. It is a research field that has applications to society and aims to solve real-world problems. It is the umbrella term for many smaller research fields including Computer Vision (Yiming’s particular field of research).</p>  
    <p>Artificial Intelligence research is a field that has applications to society and aims to solve real-world problems. It lends itself to situations where there is not repetitive labour, i.e. there needs to be intelligent decisions made on situations that unfamiliar to the system. Much like a human would when presented with new information. It has famously been applied to chess-like games, recently defeating not only chess grandmasters but also rule-based evaluation algorithms. Artificial Intelligence research has expanded across a plethora of academic disciplines in the search for true synthetic intelligence. As well as in academia, artificial intelligence has aided the progress of almost every part of today’s society.</p>
    <p>Yiming and his team use a dataset called "Mobiface" to collect training data for boosting the performance of deep learning-based trackers. The dataset, annotations and the evaluation server can be find at <a href="https://mobiface.
