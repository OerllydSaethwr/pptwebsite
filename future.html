        <br>
        <h4 class="content">
            <p>
                We cannot help but wonder, what good does face recognition technology and the ability to
                track face movement with a mobile device do to us? How can we implement these technologies to
                provide additional features to users and to develop new features? Also, what new challenges will
                arise that researchers and developers will have to tackle?
            </p>
            <p>
                One well-known implementation of face recognition is Apple’s FaceID technology,
                which allows users not only to unlock their phones, but also to authorise payments for example.
                As such, face recognition must only allow one specific person, out of 7.7 billion
                (at the time of writing!), to have access to certain features.
            </p>
            <p>
                With face tracking technology, this functionality can be extended to not only recognise a face,
                but also keep track of it for however long needed. This would allow us, for example, to pause a
                FaceTime call automatically when the caller leaves the frame to do something else, or perhaps to
                measure the speed of face movement in real time.
            </p>
            <p>
                But of course, there are still various problems to be taken care of: it is not unusual to hear
                news about Apple’s FaceID allowing strangers or identical twins to unlock phones they are not supposed
                to have access to. In the future, we can expect similar and as face tracking becomes more advanced,
                more complex problems to arise, which will also have to be dealt with to ensure user privacy.
